Analysis and Refactoring Strategy for RPChat
Based on the codebase context, I'll analyze how to effectively modularize the app.js file while maintaining the ability to serve it as a single HTML file.

Current Structure Analysis
The current app.js file contains several logical components:

Provider Configuration - Classes and data for AI providers and models
DOM Elements - References to UI elements
State Management - Handling application state
UI Initialization - Setting up the application
API Communication - Handling requests to AI providers
Message Management - Adding, editing, deleting messages
Import/Export Functionality - Saving and loading chats
UI Utilities - Helper functions for UI manipulation
Proposed Module Structure
Here's an optimal way to split the code:

config.js

AIProvider and AIModel classes
PROVIDERS map
Default system message configuration
state.js

State variables (messages, apiKeys, currentProvider)
State persistence (localStorage interactions)
api.js

API communication functions
Error handling for API requests
ui/elements.js

DOM element references
Basic UI utility functions
ui/messages.js

Message rendering
Message editing, deletion functions
Message controls
ui/controls.js

Temperature control
System prompt handling
Expanding textarea behavior
ui/importExport.js

Import/export functionality
app.js (main)

Initialization
Event binding
Orchestration between modules
Build Strategy
For the build script in Python:

Dependencies:

Use Python's standard libraries for file operations
No external dependencies needed for basic concatenation
Build Process:

Read all JS modules in the correct order
Concatenate them into a single JS file
Optionally minify the JS (using a library like jsmin)
Inject the combined JS into the HTML template
Do the same for CSS files
Development Mode:

Create a development version that loads modules separately for easier debugging
Create a production version with everything inlined
