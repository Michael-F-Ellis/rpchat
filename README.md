## Privacy
Your API keys and chat history are stored only in your browser's local storage and are never sent to any server other than the AI provider APIs for processing your messages. Please note that while your data is kept private, the AI providers may still have access to your messages for training their models. Also note that saving API keys in your browser's local storage is secure as long as no third-party libraries are introduced into the application.
