## Usage
### Requirements
- A modern browser (tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge)
- An API key for each AI provider you use.
### Basic Operation

- The AI will respond based on the conversation context
### Editing and Controls
- Click the üñäÔ∏è (edit) button on any message to modify its content
- For user messages, click the ‚ü≤ (delete from here) button to remove all subsequent messages
- System prompts can be collapsed/expanded using the toggle button
### Session Management
- Click "Clear" to start a new conversation (retaining your system prompt)
- Click "Export" to save your current chat as a JSON file
- Click "Import" to load a previously exported chat
- Click "Extract" to save the chat content to a Markdown file
### Configuration
- Change the AI provider using the dropdown at the top
- Select different models based on your chosen provider
- Choose a system prompt style from the dropdown (first person, third person, or minimal)
- Adjust the "Temperature" slider to control response randomness (higher values = more creative/random)
### System Prompts
RPChat comes with preset system prompt styles optimized for different roleplaying scenarios:
- **First Person**: For immersive roleplaying where you interact directly with AI characters. This is the default for new chats.
- **Third Person**: For collaborative storytelling from an observer perspective
- **Minimal**: A simple assistant prompt for general conversation, e.g. interactively developing characters or summarizing a plot line.

You can select a style from the dropdown or edit the system prompt by clicking the edit button on the system message at the beginning of the conversation. Note that your customized versions will be saved when you export a chat and restored when you import it.

## Privacy
Your API keys and chat history are stored only in your browser's local storage and are never sent to any server other than the AI provider APIs for processing your messages. Please note that while your data is kept private, the AI providers may still have access to your messages for training their models. Also note that saving API keys in your browser's local storage is secure as long as no third-party libraries are introduced into the application.
